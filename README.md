# Smalls

Whilst adventuring in Skyrim SE, you tend to run across all sorts of bandits, ruffians and ne'er-do-wells. Typically it ends messily, and then you loot the bodies for armour and treasure.

If you're running with mod that replaces the default skin with a naked one, it's a bit disconcerting to discover that everyone whose armour you loot seems to be going commando. What's up with that? Didn't their mothers warn them that they might meet a sticky end one day and thus clearly ought to pack some clean underwear for their trip just in case?

This mod attempts to fix this problem in the least intrusive way possible.

## How It Works

There are two basic approaches to this problem.

One (as used by [Equipable Underwear For Everyone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17183)) is to patch up all-the-things, so that all characters and NPCs already have underwear on by the time you meet them.

This is a bit complicated, and has some inherent problems. It also really needs to be done at the start of the game, and it's tricky to add or remove the mod at other times without leaving things in a bit of a mess.

The other approach is much simpler - I call it "Just In Time Underwear". We leave absolutely everything in the game world alone, until you interract with a dead character. At that point, if you steal their clothes, we quickly add back some underwear, so that they appear to be modestly dressed.

There are some problems with this approach too. The main one is that the immersion is imperfect, since you usually get a brief flash of them naked before the underwear appears. On the other hand, it is minimally intrusive and can be enabled/disabled at any point.

As you have probably guessed, Smalls takes the second approach.
